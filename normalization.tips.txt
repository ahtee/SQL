	partial dependencies
	Transitive dependencies  - dotted line

2NF - all attributes

	partial dependencies have become 	desireable 	dependencies
	transitive dependencies - dotted line

3NF - All attributes
	partial dependencies are all their own tables
	partial dependencies have becone desirable dependencies 
	transitive dependencies have becme their own tables 
	transitive dependencies have become desirable dependencies 
	An appropriate PK/FK has been added
	
Text format for each table
add (( STUDENT (S_ID, S_Fname, S_Lname,,,,,,,,,) )) add underline on PK
